## CSE 620B - Remote Sensing and Computer Vision - QGIS Installation

### Installation

QGIS was installed on Arch Linux (w/i3wm) via the package manager, pacman.

### Data Sources

Raster data was downloaded via [USGS EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/order/index/). Data focuses on the greater-Kalamazoo area of Michigan.

Vector data was downloaded via [OverpassTurbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/#). Data lists features matching the keyword 'route', intending to capture the state routes in greater Kalamazoo.

### Visualization

Raster and vector data were visualized in QGIS. The vector data intentionally extends beyond the raster data, since the map area where raster and vector data overlap is difficult to discern raster vs vector data in the image.
